# DVDLibrary

This DVD library is an example of a basic CRUD application

It allows the user to create, view (read), update and delete DVDs into a DVD library

It contains the basic information about the DVDs like the title, release date, director's name etc

The data is written and read from a .txt file

The user searches for the DVDs based on the title so no DVD id is necessary
